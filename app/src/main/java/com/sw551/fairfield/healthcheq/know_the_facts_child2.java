Without radically changing your diet, you can increase your calorie intake with each meal by adding nut or seed toppings, cheese and healthy side dishes.  <br><br><b> • </b> Try almonds, sunflower seeds, fruit or whole-grain wheat toast. Go nutrient dense. Instead of eating a lot of empty calories and junk food, focus on eating foods that are rich in nutrients. <br><br><b> • </b> Consider high-protein meats, which can help you to build muscle. Also, choose nutritious carbohydrates, such as brown rice and other whole grains. This helps ensure your body is receiving as much nourishment as possible, even if you’re dealing with a reduced appetite. <br><br><b> • </b> Snack away. Enjoy snacks that contain plenty of protein and healthy carbohydrates. Consider options like trail mix, protein bars or drinks, and crackers with hummus or peanut butter. Also enjoy snacks that contain “good fats,” which are important for a healthy heart. Examples include nuts and avocados. <br><br><b> • </b> Eat mini-meals. If you’re struggling with a curbed appetite due to medical or emotional issues, taking in large portions of food may not seem appealing. <br><br><b> • </b> Consider eating smaller meals throughout the day to increase your calorie intake. <br><br><b> • </b> Bulk up. While too much aerobic exercise will burn calories and ultimately work against your weight goal, strength training– such as weight-lifting or yoga–can help you gain weight by building muscle. <br> <br> <br> <b><h3> Normal Weight :</h3></b> <b> • </b>Exercise. Regular physical activity burns calories and builds muscle — both of which help you look and feel good and keep weight off. <br><br><b> • </b> Walking the family dog, cycling to school, and doing other things that increase your daily level of activity can all make a difference. <br><br><b> • </b> If you want to burn more calories, increase the intensity of your workout and add some strength exercises to build muscle. The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn, even when you are exercising. <br><br><b> • </b> Reduce screen time. One reason people get less exercise these days is because of an increase in out;screen time out; — the amount of time spent watching TV, looking at the computer, using mobile devices, or playing video games. Limit recreational screen time to less than 2 hours per day. <br><br><b> • </b> If you are with friends at the mall, you are getting more exercise than if you are texting them from your room. <br><br><b> • </b> Watch out for portion distortion. Portion sizes are bigger than they used to be, and these extra calories contribute to obesity. <br><br><b> • </b> Another key factor in weight gain is that more people drink sugary beverages, such as sodas, juice drinks, and sports drinks. So choose smaller portions (or share restaurant portions) and go for water or low-fat milk instead of soda.  <br><br><b> • </b> Eat 5 servings of fruits and veggies a day. Fruits and veggies are about more than just vitamins and minerals. They are also packed with fiber, which means they fill you up. And when you fill up on fruits and veggies, you are less likely to overeat. <br><br><b> • </b> Don't skip breakfast. Breakfast kick-starts your metabolism, burning calories from the get-go and giving you energy to do more during the day. People who skip breakfast often feel so hungry that they eat more later on. So they get more calories than they would have if they ate breakfast. <br><br><b> • </b> In fact, people who skip breakfast tend to have higher BMIs than people who eat breakfast.  <br> <br> <br> <b> <h3>Over Weight :    Obesity :</h3></b> <b> • </b>Calculate How Much You Should Lose Calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) by writing entering your weight and height into a BMI calculator available on various websites. Calculated manually, you will divide your weight by your height. BMI will calculate whether you’re a normal weight or obese. <br><br><b> • </b> Change Your Eating Habits If you find that you’re overweight or obese, you should change your eating habits by following the weight loss tips from experts. <br><br><b> • </b> Eat more lean meats, fresh, leafy vegetables, and reduce the portions. Cut out excess sugars, salts, and fats. Drink more water to keep hydrated and feeling full. <br><br><b> • </b> Eat Regularly It’s important to eat regularly and avoid skipping meals. If you skip meals, your body will store more fat than if you eat small, light, and nutritious meals throughout the day. <br><br><b> • </b> Exercise Regularly If you are obese, you may think that exercise is something you cannot possibly do. However, a sedentary lifestyle is contrary to the weight loss tips you must follow. Start out by sitting and lying exercises, eventually working up to standing and moving exercises. This will help burn extra calories and speed your weight loss. <br><br><b> • </b> Quit Eating Processed Foods Processed foods are full of preservatives, fat, salt, and sugars. Prepackaged frozen foods are easy to prepare, but are full of bad ingredients that are not advised in weight loss tips of professionals. <br><br><b> • </b> Try Baking Instead of Frying The use of baking allows you to have tender vegetables and meats without the excess butter and oils. If you must fry, try using a lighter canola or sunflower oil. <br><br><b> • </b> Stick to Natural Ingredients Fresh fruits and vegetables are filling and low in processed sugars and fats. Local farmer’s markets are full of great buys like apples, peaches, lettuce, and spinach that will help you lose weight. And walking around those markets is a good form of exercise and an extra benefit. <br><br><b> • </b> Try Natural Herbs Natural herbs such as green tea and aloe vera are regarded helpful in losing weight, controlling the storage of fat in the body. <br><br><b> • </b> Incorporate Different Spices into Your Food Certain spices added to your foods can help lose weight and should be added to your weight loss tips. Cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and black pepper are three spices that will help lose weight. <br><br><b> • </b> Use Vinegar Two teaspoons of vinegar in a glass of water is said to aid weight loss. It also enhances the taste of some foods. It acts as a diuretic to reduce water weight gain. Be careful. You want to keep hydrated at all times when trying to lose weight. <br><br><b> • </b> Get Some of the Stress Out of Your Life Studies indicate that stress in your life makes some people eat excessively. Try breathing exercises to calm yourself. <br> <br> <br> <b><h3>Healthy Tips :</h3></b> <b>•</b> 	Focus on fruits. Eat a variety of fruits — fresh, frozen, canned, or dried — rather than fruit juice for most of your fruit choices. For a 2,000-calorie diet, you will need 2 cups of fruit each day. An example of 2 cups is 1 small banana, 1 large orange, and 1/4 cup of dried apricots or peaches. <br> <br> <b>•</b> 	Vary your veggies. Eat more: o	dark green veggies, such as broccoli, kale, and other dark leafy greens o	orange veggies, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, and winter squash o	beans and peas, such as pinto beans, kidney beans, black beans, garbanzo beans, split peas, and lentils. <br> <br><b> • </b>	Get your calcium-rich foods. Each day, drink 3 cups of low-fat or fat-free milk. Or, you can get an equivalent amount of low-fat yogurt and/or low-fat cheese each day. 1.5 ounces of cheese equals 1 cup of milk. If you don&apos;t or can&apos;t consume milk, choose lactose-free milk products and/or calcium-fortified foods and drinks. <br> <br> <b>•</b>  Make half your grains whole. Eat at least 3 ounces of whole-grain cereals, breads, crackers, rice, or pasta each day. One ounce is about 1 slice of bread, 1 cup of breakfast cereal, or 1/2 cup of cooked rice or pasta. Look to see that grains such as wheat, rice, oats, or corn are referred to as &quot;whole&quot; in the list of ingredients. <br> <br> <b>•</b>  Go lean with protein. Choose lean meats and poultry. Bake it, broil it, or grill it. Vary your protein choices with more fish, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds. <br> <br> <b>•</b>  Limit saturated fats. Get less than 10 percent of your calories from saturated fatty acids. Most fats should come from sources of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, such as fish, nuts, and vegetable oils. When choosing and preparing meat, poultry, dry beans, and milk or milk products, make choices that are lean, low-fat, or fat-free. <br> <br> <b>•</b>  Limit salt. Get less than 2,300 mg of sodium (about 1 teaspoon of salt) each day.</p>"));
